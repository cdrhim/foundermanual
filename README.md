# Founder Manual by Anthony
The founder manual for startups (from 2023 and onwards).

**IR**
- Make reasons not to invest in the startup - try to convince what steps to take to overcome them.
- Not put more than 4 people on the slide and compress their introductions - people would not read them.
- Do 2 versions of IR, a short version for the public & general interest, and an exhaustive version for individual interested investors.
