# Founder Manual by Anthony Rhim
The founder manual for startups (from 2023 and onwards).

**IR**
- Be technical and give the numbers on the slides for investors to just understand what you are saying.
- Make reasons not to invest in the startup - try to convince what steps to take to overcome them.
- Not put more than 4 people on the slide and compress their introductions - people would not read them.
- Do 2 versions of IR, a short version for the public & general interest, and an exhaustive version for individual interested investors.

**BM**
- Focus on the value first. BMs can be helped made by investors.
- Focus on either B2B or B2C first. Do not go with both markets at the same time. They are totally different segments, which require more time invested in total.

**Work Ethics**
- Networking is king. Update your progress to potentially essential nodes in quarterly or half yearly intervals.
